# nasa-dart-easter-egg
I've always been fascinated by how beautiful our planet is and the discovery astronauts make every day. It's been my dream to work at NASA at some point in my life and hopefully one day, that dream will be a reality. NASA crashinga a spacecraft on an Asteroid was particularly a very exciting news for me and I wanted to watch it live. Immediately the Dart Mission was sucessfull, I was happy to say the least. I woke up the next day and I wanted to know what people and reporters have to say about the mission so like every person will do now, I went on Google and typed NASA's Dart mission. Immediately I got my search results I noticed something very exciting on my web page. It was an easter egg for the mission, we all know Google likes to give us an easter egg for every notable event, I didn't expect to see that. I kept refreshing the page just to see the easter egg, it was kind of very surreal for me. Then I decided to recreate it using HTML and CSS and yh, that's basically it. It isn't mobile responsive thou so you can only get the perfect view of what it looks like on screens larger than 1024px. Thank you for reading and see you later with more exciting projects :)
